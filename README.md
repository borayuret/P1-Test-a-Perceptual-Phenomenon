# P1: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

<h2>Background Information</h2>

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

<h2>Questions For Investigation</h2>

[Dataset: stroopdata.csv](stroopdata.csv)
<p>

<h3> 1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable? </h3>

<b>Independent Variable:</b> Congruent and incongruent words
<br>
<b>Dependent Variable:</b> Time to name the color

<p>

<h3> 2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.</h3>

<b>Ho (Null Hypothesis):</b> The time required to name the color for congruent word is equal to the time required to name the color of incongruent word. 

<b>Ha (Alternative Hypothesis):</b> The time required to name the color for congruent word is not equal to the time required to name the color of incongruent word. 

<p>

<b>I will use a Paired T-Test because: </b> <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - i don't know the populations standard deviation <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - i have a limited sample (n < 30) <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - data is derived from subjects who have been measured at two time points (each individual has two measurements) <br>

<h3>3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.</h3>
